HiðŸª¼
I'm Fili
This is my first little Portfolio:)
The javascript skill knowledge is just to fill out the section a bit better :) We haven't stardet learning javascript yet.
Hope you enjoy my (full of jellyfish) Portfolio:)
ðŸª¼


Important Steps of my code ðŸ’ž :

## @keyframes ____{
}

here i wanted for a nice opening effect the h1 to be increasing in size and color to be an eyecatching factor.
```css
 @keyframes increaseSize {
            0% {
              font-size: 0px;
                color: #466AE0;
            }
            50% {
              font-size: 60px;
             
            }
            100% {
              font-size: 100px;
            }
          }
          
          h1 {
            animation: increaseSize 1s linear;
          }
```

## scroll-bar

The next was a suprise to me, i never considered that one could change the size and color of the scrollbar! So when my colleague showed his code i was flabbergasted! And of course! i wanted to try it too!
And to say the least it was very easy actually :

```css
*{
     scrollbar-color: hsl(226, 71%, 58%, 0.9) blue ;
}

.text{
scrollbar-color:rgb(63, 2, 63) blue ;
}
```

## scroll-snap , scroll-snap-align, scroll-snap-type

In one Example Portfolio, the scrolling snaped the user back or forth to next or last element, which would've fit perfectly for my code! So naturally i didn't really have a choice, and started googling for this type of code.


```css
*{
    scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
}
header, .oben, .mess, .ganzunten{
    /* text-align: center; */
    scroll-snap-align: center;
    /* flex: none; */
  }
```

## background: url(____.jpg);

For my background i used free Pictures from the Website [Pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/).The darkness of the water and the light,pretty colors of the jellyfish made a nice contrast in my opinion so i only used pictures of them ðŸª¼.I hope you like it :)
